## Section 2. AGPL Trigger ‚Äì AI-Generated or Derivative Use

If this software is incorporated into a product, service, or system that **uses AI generation of code**, or meets any of the conditions below, the software is governed instead by the **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPL-3.0)** in full.

### 2.1 AI-Generation and Automation Triggers
The AGPL applies if **any** of the following are true:
1. AI is used to automatically generate **Decaf-TS front-end or back-end code**.
2. AI tools or workflows generate Decaf-TS code automatically or on demand.
3. Integration occurs via **Decaf MCP** or any mechanism that enables AI-driven Decaf code generation.
4. The software is used to generate **dynamic UIs for AI agent conversation apps**, including chat-based, multimodal, or interactive systems.
5. AI is used in combination with this software to generate software **at scale** (e.g., automated pipelines, batch or continuous generation).
6. The product or service **sells software or applications generated via AI** that leverage this software, directly or indirectly.

### 2.2 Clarifications and Exceptions
The AGPL does **not** apply when:
- AI is used **only during development**, e.g. a developer uses AI and Decaf tooling as assistive tools to write or review code manually.
- A company develops a **Decaf-based product** with AI internally, but the **resulting product does not generate additional Decaf code itself**.

In all other cases described in 2.1, this software is licensed under AGPL-3.0.

## Section 3. Specification and Protocol Coverage

This license applies not only to the software implementation but also to **any associated API specifications, data formats, or protocols** defined by this project.  
Re-use of these definitions verbatim or in substantial part constitutes use under this license.  
(This does not restrict legitimate interoperability under fair use or equivalent law.)

## Section 4. Trademarks and Branding

The names, logos, and visual identifiers associated with this project (e.g., ‚ÄúDecaf,‚Äù ‚ÄúDecaf-TS,‚Äù and any related marks) are **not licensed** under the MIT or AGPL terms.  
No right is granted to use them in modified or derived works without express written permission from Tiago Venceslau or the Decaf project governance body.  
All other rights are reserved.

## Section 5. Attribution and Moral Rights

All derivative or substantially similar works must include clear and prominent attribution to the original authors and a link to this repository.  
Attribution must appear in documentation, UI ‚ÄúAbout‚Äù sections, or equivalent locations visible to end users.  
Nothing in this license waives the moral rights of the authors as recognized under applicable law.

---

## Section 6. Examples (for clarity)

- ‚úÖ **MIT**: A developer uses Decaf tooling and AI to build a product manually.
- ‚úÖ **MIT**: A company ships a Decaf-based product that does not itself generate Decaf code.
- üîí **AGPL**: A service that uses AI to generate Decaf UIs for users.
- üîí **AGPL**: A pipeline that automatically produces and deploys code using this software.
- üîí **AGPL**: A business selling software produced by AI using this framework.

## Section 7. Funding and Non-Profit Support

All licensing under this Fair Usage License supports the Decaf framework as a nonprofit initiative.  
Contributions, sponsorships, and donations directly help sustain the open Decaf ecosystem.  
See the project's FUNDING.md for details on how to support development.
