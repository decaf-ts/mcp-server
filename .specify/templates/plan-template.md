# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

The plan MUST include a short Constitution Check that verifies the plan complies with the project's
core principles. At minimum, the check MUST declare the status (Complies / Partial / Violates) for:

- Code Organization: confirm proposed folder layout follows module-boundary rules (one logical
  module per folder, limited export surface).
- File & Export Conventions: confirm whether the plan requires multi-class files, index re-exports,
  or changes to the export surface (if so, justify and provide migration steps).
- Test-First Quality: confirm which tests will be added before implementation (unit/integration)
  and any coverage expectations for changed modules.
- Design Patterns: list any established patterns the plan relies on (Factory, Strategy, etc.) and
  justify pattern choices when they impact public API or lifecycle.
- Review & CI Impact: list the CI checks the plan depends on (lint, tests, coverage) and any
  required changes to CI configuration.

If any of the checks are Partial or Violates, the plan MUST include mitigation or a migration plan
to be reviewed during Phase 1.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
