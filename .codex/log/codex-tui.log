+# Decaf MCP Server Constitution
+
+## Core Principles
+
+### I. Template Fidelity
+- Keep all production TypeScript under `src/`, re-export the public surface through `src/index.ts`, and add new entry points only with documented architectural approval.
+- Tests MUST live exclusively in `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, or `tests/bundling` and follow the `*.test.ts` convention; adding new test roots requires a governance decision.
+- Update the CLI help, README, and workdocs whenever behavior or commands change so template adopters always receive accurate instructions.
+**Rationale**: This repository is the canonical Decaf TypeScript template; structural drift or stale documentation propagates mistakes across every downstream project.
+
+### II. Dual-Target Distribution
+- Every change that touches source, build tooling, or dependencies MUST run `npm run build` and `npm run build:prod`, ensuring both emit CJS and ESM artifacts to `lib/` and bundled outputs to `dist/`.
+- Maintain parity between the published exports (`import`/`require`) and the CLI binary at `lib/bin/cli.cjs`; the shebang and chmod logic belongs to `npm run make-exec` and must not be bypassed.
+- When bundler or packaging behavior changes, run `npm run test:dist`, note the semver impact, and document upgrade guidance before merging.
+**Rationale**: Consumers depend on predictable dual-module consumption and a working CLI; drift in packaging silently breaks template-generated services.
+
+### III. Verification Discipline
+- Start work by updating the relevant `.specify` spec/plan/tasks files and writing the failing unit or integration tests before implementation whenever practical.
+- Unit suites may not mock internal modules; cross-module or CLI behaviors move to `tests/integration` or `tests/bundling` where full flows can be asserted.
+- `npm run coverage` (which drives `test:all`) is mandatory before merge, and coverage artifacts must be refreshed under `workdocs/reports/data/`; regressions require maintainer approval plus remediation tasks.
+**Rationale**: The template must remain trustworthy; enforcing fail-first tests and published coverage stops regressions from propagating to every repository cloned from this project.
+
+### IV. Documentation & Observability
+- Keep README content, `docs/` output, and `workdocs/tutorials` synchronized with the latest commands, environment expectations, and onboarding steps.
+- Regenerate diagrams and visual assets through `npm run drawings` and `npm run uml`, copying results into `workdocs/resources/` whenever flows, schemas, or contracts change.
+- Preserve structured logging and telemetry through CLI/stdout so template users can debug via text streams or JSON parsers without additional tooling.
+**Rationale**: Documentation and traceability are the only way downstream teams can adopt, troubleshoot, and extend the template without direct maintainer involvement.
+
+### V. Automation & Trusted Tooling
+- Use the provided npm scripts for installation, linting, builds, publishing, and repo automation (`do-install`, `prepare-pr`, `repo:*`, `docker:*`, `sync-codex`); deviations must be justified in-plan and reviewed.
+- Secrets live only in the token files (`.token`, `.npmtoken`, `.dockeruser`, `.dockertoken`, `.confluence-token`) and are referenced through scriptsâ€”never echoed into history or config.
+- Codex automation outputs (plan/spec/tasks/checklist) are authoritative for scope, gates, and acceptance; implementation may not skip steps without updating those artifacts.
+**Rationale**: Reproducible automation and disciplined secret handling keep releases safe and auditable across contributors and CI environments.
+
+## Operational Guardrails
+
+- **Environment**: Develop and test with Node â‰¥22 and npm â‰¥10; verify the CLI inside the same Debian-based containers that CI uses to avoid platform drift.
+- **Source Layout**: Keep TypeScript in `src/`, generated declarations/JS in `lib/`, bundled artifacts in `dist/`, documentation inputs in `workdocs/`, and auto-generated docs in `docs/`.
+- **Build & Docs Pipelines**: Run `npm run build` for development, `npm run build:prod` for releases, `npm run docs` for the static site, and `npm run drawings`/`npm run uml` before publishing refreshed diagrams.
+- **Quality Commands**: `npm run lint`, `npm run coverage`, and (when applicable) `npm run test:dist` must succeed locally before opening a PR; `npm run prepare-pr` ties them together for release confidence.
+- **Credentials & Distribution**: Consume registry, Docker, and Confluence credentials only through the scripted commands; treat `lib/` and `dist/` as generated artifacts that must not be hand-edited.
+
+## Delivery Workflow & Quality Gates
+
+1. **Specification First**: Capture the user stories and requirements in `/specs/[###-feature]/spec.md`, instantiate `plan.md` via `/speckit.plan`, and ensure the Constitution Check passes before any coding.
+2. **Task Breakdown**: Generate `/specs/[###-feature]/tasks.md` grouped by user story so each increment is independently testable, aligning with the Verification Discipline principle.
+3. **Implementation**: Keep code within the sanctioned directories, write failing tests, then implement; integration changes must note which npm scripts or docs they impact.
+4. **Pre-PR Validation**: Run `lint`, `build:prod`, `coverage`, `docs`, and `test:dist` when packaging or CLI behavior shifts; attach coverage and doc artifacts (or deltas) to the PR.
+5. **Review & Merge**: Reviewers verify that principles are honored, documentation is updated, and any deviations are logged in the Complexity Tracking table plus governance notes.
+
+## Governance
+
+- **Supremacy**: This constitution overrides conflicting docs; any discrepancy must be resolved by updating the subordinate doc or amending this file.
+- **Amendment Process**:
+  1. Open a governance issue describing the needed change and whether it is Major, Minor, or Patch.
+  2. Draft updates to this constitution plus all dependent templates/docs, including a refreshed Sync Impact Report.
+  3. Run `npm run prepare-pr`, attach the diff, and secure approval from at least one project maintainer.
+  4. Communicate migration steps (if any) in README or release notes before merging.
+- **Versioning**: Bump MAJOR when removing/redefining principles or governance; bump MINOR for new principles/sections or substantial guidance expansions; bump PATCH for clarifications or typo fixes. Document the bump rationale inside the Sync Impact Report and PR description.
+- **Compliance Review**: Maintainers audit compliance quarterly and before every release tag, sampling recent merges to ensure Template Fidelity, build outputs, documentation, and automation requirements remain in force. Non-compliant work is rolled back or hot-fixed immediately.
