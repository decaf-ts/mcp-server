+# Decaf MCP Server Constitution
+
+## Core Principles
+
+### I. Template Fidelity
+- Keep all production TypeScript under `src/`, re-export the public surface through `src/index.ts`, and add new entry points only with documented architectural approval.
+- Tests MUST live exclusively in `tests/unit`, `tests/integration`, or `tests/bundling` and follow the `*.test.ts` convention; adding new test roots requires a governance decision.
+- Update the CLI help, README, and workdocs whenever behavior or commands change so template adopters always receive accurate instructions.
+**Rationale**: This repository is the canonical Decaf TypeScript template; structural drift or stale documentation propagates mistakes across every downstream project.
+
+### II. Dual-Target Distribution
+- Every change that touches source, build tooling, or dependencies MUST run `npm run build` and `npm run build:prod`, ensuring both emit CJS and ESM artifacts to `lib/` and bundled outputs to `dist/`.
+- Maintain parity between the published exports (`import`/`require`) and the CLI binary at `lib/bin/cli.cjs`; the shebang and chmod logic belongs to `npm run make-exec` and must not be bypassed.
+- When bundler or packaging behavior changes, run `npm run test:dist`, note the semver impact, and document upgrade guidance before merging.
+**Rationale**: Consumers depend on predictable dual-module consumption and a working CLI; drift in packaging silently breaks template-generated services.
+
+### III. Verification Discipline
+- Start work by updating the relevant `.specify` spec/plan/tasks files and writing the failing unit or integration tests before implementation whenever practical.
+- Unit suites may not mock internal modules; cross-module or CLI behaviors move to `tests/integration` or `tests/bundling` where full flows can be asserted.
+- `npm run coverage` (which drives `test:all`) is mandatory before merge, and coverage artifacts must be refreshed under `workdocs/reports/data/`; regressions require maintainer approval plus remediation tasks.
+**Rationale**: The template must remain trustworthy; enforcing fail-first tests and published coverage stops regressions from propagating to every repository cloned from this project.
+
+### IV. Documentation & Observability
+- Keep README content, `docs/` output, and `workdocs/tutorials` synchronized with the latest commands, environment expectations, and onboarding steps.
+- Regenerate diagrams and visual assets through `npm run drawings` and `npm run uml`, copying results into `workdocs/resources/` whenever flows, schemas, or contracts change.
+- Preserve structured logging and telemetry through CLI/stdout so template users can debug via text streams or JSON parsers without additional tooling.
+**Rationale**: Documentation and traceability are the only way downstream teams can adopt, troubleshoot, and extend the template without direct maintainer involvement.
+
+### V. Automation & Trusted Tooling
+- Use the provided npm scripts for installation, linting, builds, publishing, and repo automation (`do-install`, `prepare-pr`, `repo:*`, `docker:*`, `sync-codex`); deviations must be justified in-plan and reviewed.
+- Secrets live only in the token files (`.token`, `.npmtoken`, `.dockeruser`, `.dockertoken`, `.confluence-token`) and are referenced through scriptsâ€”never echoed into history or config.
+- Codex automation outputs (plan/spec/tasks/checklist) are authoritative for scope, gates, and acceptance; implementation may not skip steps without updating those artifacts.
+**Rationale**: Reproducible automation and disciplined secret handling keep releases safe and auditable across contributors and CI environments.
+
+## Operational Guardrails
+
+- **Environment**: Develop and test with Node â‰¥22 and npm â‰¥10; verify the CLI inside the same Debian-based containers that CI uses to avoid platform drift.
+- **Source Layout**: Keep TypeScript in `src/`, generated declarations/JS in `lib/`, bundled artifacts in `dist/`, documentation inputs in `workdocs/`, and auto-generated docs in `docs/`.
+- **Build & Docs Pipelines**: Run `npm run build` for development, `npm run build:prod` for releases, `npm run docs` for the static site, and `npm run drawings`/`npm run uml` before publishing refreshed diagrams.
+- **Quality Commands**: `npm run lint`, `npm run coverage`, and (when applicable) `npm run test:dist` must succeed locally before opening a PR; `npm run prepare-pr` ties them together for release confidence.
+- **Credentials & Distribution**: Consume registry, Docker, and Confluence credentials only through the scripted commands; treat `lib/` and `dist/` as generated artifacts that must not be hand-edited.
+
+## Delivery Workflow & Quality Gates
+
+1. **Specification First**: Capture the user stories and requirements in `/specs/[###-feature]/spec.md`, instantiate `plan.md` via `/speckit.plan`, and ensure the Constitution Check passes before any coding.
+2. **Task Breakdown**: Generate `/specs/[###-feature]/tasks.md` grouped by user story so each increment is independently testable, aligning with the Verification Discipline principle.
+3. **Implementation**: Keep code within the sanctioned directories, write failing tests, then implement; integration changes must note which npm scripts or docs they impact.
+4. **Pre-PR Validation**: Run `lint`, `build:prod`, `coverage`, `docs`, and `test:dist` when packaging or CLI behavior shifts; attach coverage and doc artifacts (or deltas) to the PR.
+5. **Review & Merge**: Reviewers verify that principles are honored, documentation is updated, and any deviations are logged in the Complexity Tracking table plus governance notes.
+
+## Governance
+
+- **Supremacy**: This constitution overrides conflicting docs; any discrepancy must be resolved by updating the subordinate doc or amending this file.
+- **Amendment Process**:
+  1. Open a governance issue describing the needed change and whether it is Major, Minor, or Patch.
+  2. Draft updates to this constitution plus all dependent templates/docs, including a refreshed Sync Impact Report.
+  3. Run `npm run prepare-pr`, attach the diff, and secure approval from at least one project maintainer.
+  4. Communicate migration steps (if any) in README or release notes before merging.
+- **Versioning**: Bump MAJOR when removing/redefining principles or governance; bump MINOR for new principles/sections or substantial guidance expansions; bump PATCH for clarifications or typo fixes. Document the bump rationale inside the Sync Impact Report and PR description.
+- **Compliance Review**: Maintainers audit compliance quarterly and before every release tag, sampling recent merges to ensure Template Fidelity, build outputs, documentation, and automation requirements remain in force. Non-compliant work is rolled back or hot-fixed immediately.

+**Input**: User description: "this repo is an MCP server using FASTMCP to be used by coding assistant LLMs to write code for the decaf-ts typescript framework. keep src/mcp and each folder in ./src/modules with the same structure: - prompts folder that exports a list of prompts for the MCP; - resources folder that export a list of resources for the MCP; - templates folder that export a list of templates; - tools folder that export a list of tools; the main server must consum these exports to enrich"

+### User Story 1 - Standardize Module Scaffolding (Priority: P1)
+
+Template maintainers need every `src/modules/*` directory (current and future) to share the same four subfoldersâ€”`prompts`, `resources`, `templates`, `tools`â€”each exporting a strongly-typed list so MCP-compatible assistants can rely on predictable structure.
+
+**Why this priority**: Without structural parity the template cannot be safely re-used in downstream repos, creating integration bugs for every new assistant capability.
+
+**Independent Test**: Run the module validation task against a module (real or stub) and confirm it detects any missing folder/export before allowing the module to be published.
+
+**Acceptance Scenarios**:
+
+1. **Given** a maintainer scaffolds a new module under `src/modules`, **When** the scaffolding script runs, **Then** the four folders plus index exports are created with placeholder lists.
+2. **Given** an existing module is missing a folder or list export, **When** validation executes during `npm run lint` or `npm run test:unit`, **Then** it fails with a message naming the offending module and folder.

+### User Story 2 - Aggregate Module Assets into MCP Server (Priority: P2)
+
+The MCP server maintainer wants `src/mcp` to mirror the same prompts/resources/templates/tools folders and automatically merge each moduleâ€™s exported lists so FASTMCP sessions expose a unified catalog.
+
+**Why this priority**: Aggregation keeps assistant responses consistent regardless of which modules supply the assets, and prevents manual wiring errors inside the MCP host.
+
+**Independent Test**: Run a targeted integration test that loads only the MCP layer, injects two sample modules, and verifies the serverâ€™s exported arrays include every item exactly once.
+
+**Acceptance Scenarios**:
+
+1. **Given** at least one module exports prompts/resources/templates/tools, **When** the MCP server boots, **Then** it imports each module list and makes the concatenated lists available through the FASTMCP interfaces.
+2. **Given** two modules export items with identical identifiers, **When** the server aggregates them, **Then** it logs a duplication issue and prevents conflicting entries from being registered.

+### User Story 3 - LLM Receives Enriched Context (Priority: P3)
+
+Coding assistant LLM operators need every FASTMCP session to present the consolidated prompts, resources, templates, and tools so assistants can reason about the Decaf TS framework without manual lookups.
+
+**Why this priority**: The productâ€™s value is tied to how quickly assistants can discover and use Decaf assets; missing context reduces quality of generated code.
+
+**Independent Test**: Execute an end-to-end run where the MCP server exposes its capability manifest to a mock assistant and verify the assistant receives the enriched artifact lists.
+
+**Acceptance Scenarios**:
+
+1. **Given** a FASTMCP client connects to the Decaf MCP server, **When** it enumerates available prompts/resources/templates/tools, **Then** it sees the aggregated catalog with module provenance metadata.
+2. **Given** a module is temporarily disabled, **When** the assistant requests assets, **Then** the catalog excludes that module while still presenting remaining modules without errors.

-### Edge Cases

-<!--
-  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
-  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
--->
-
-- What happens when [boundary condition]?
-- How does system handle [error scenario]?
+### Edge Cases
+
+- Module directory exists but only some required folders are present; validation must fail with a clear message and remediation hint.
+- Two modules export identically named prompts/resources/templates/tools; aggregation needs deterministic conflict handling (warn, skip, and surface collision in logs/tests).
+- MCP root directories contain additional experimental content; validation must ignore non-required folders yet enforce the canonical four.
+- Loading dozens of modules simultaneously; aggregation must finish within acceptable startup time without exceeding memory guidance.

-### Functional Requirements
-
-- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
-- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
-- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
-- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
-- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]
-
-*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
-
-- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
-- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]
+### Functional Requirements
+
+- **FR-001**: Every folder under `src/modules/*` MUST contain `prompts`, `resources`, `templates`, and `tools` subfolders, each exporting a typed list of assets consumable by FASTMCP.
+- **FR-002**: The `src/mcp` directory MUST mirror the same four folders and expose master lists generated by concatenating the module exports.
+- **FR-003**: A validation routine MUST run during `npm run lint` or `npm run test:unit` to fail the pipeline if any module is missing a folder, lacks an export, or produces an empty list without an explicit `disabled` flag.
+- **FR-004**: Aggregation MUST detect duplicate asset identifiers across modules and output a deterministic error that points to the offending modules while preventing collisions from reaching clients.
+- **FR-005**: Documentation (README/workdocs) MUST describe how to add a new module, the required folder contents, and how the MCP server consumes exports so downstream template users follow the pattern.
+- **FR-006**: The MCP server MUST expose provenance metadata (module name and path) alongside each prompt/resource/template/tool so assistants know the source of each asset.
+- **FR-007**: All generated code and validation changes MUST maintain compatibility with Node â‰¥22 / npm â‰¥10 and keep `npm run build`, `npm run build:prod`, and `npm run test:dist` passing to honor Dual-Target Distribution.

-### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
-
-- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
-- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]
+### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
+
+- **Module Export Package**: Conceptual bundle representing one moduleâ€™s prompts/resources/templates/tools lists plus metadata (module name, version, disabled flag).
+- **MCP Aggregate Catalog**: The combined asset arrays exposed by the MCP server after merging all module export packages and performing validation/conflict resolution.
+- **Validation Report**: Structured output (console + optional JSON) emitted by the validation routine, capturing missing folders, empty exports, duplicates, and guidance for remediation.
+
+## Assumptions
+
+- Existing modules (`src/modules/decoration`, `src/modules/mcp`, future ones) will be backfilled to the standard without deprecating them.
+- Module owners can supply placeholder assets if a folder would otherwise be empty, ensuring validation focuses on structural integrity rather than content completeness.
+- FASTMCP clients expect descriptive errors instead of silent degradation, so surfacing validation failures during CI is sufficient to block regressions.

 ### Measurable Outcomes
 
-- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
-- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
-- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
-- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]
+- **SC-001**: 100% of modules under `src/modules` pass the structural validation routine with zero missing folders or exports before each merge.
+- **SC-002**: MCP server startup completes in under 3 seconds with up to 20 modules loaded while still aggregating all asset types.
+- **SC-003**: At least 95% of FASTMCP capability manifests generated in testing include provenance metadata for every prompt/resource/template/tool.
+- **SC-004**: Documentation updates reduce maintainer setup time for a new module to under 30 minutes as measured by internal onboarding feedback.
