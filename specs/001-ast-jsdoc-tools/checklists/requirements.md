# Specification Quality Checklist: AST → JSDoc Tools

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) — PASS
	- Note: The spec was sanitized to remove an explicit library mention; implementation hints are recorded in Assumptions.
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs — PASS
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders — PASS
- [x] All mandatory sections completed — PASS

## Requirement Completeness
## Requirement Completeness

 - [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain — PASS
 	- Note: Clarification applied on 2025-10-25 — heuristics (Option B) selected as default context source for TOOL4; mapping file override supported.
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous — PASS
- [x] Success criteria are measurable — PASS
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) — PASS
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined — PASS
- [x] Edge cases are identified — PASS
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded — PASS
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified — PASS
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria — PASS
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows — PASS
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria — PASS
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification — PASS
	- Note: Implementation mention was moved to Assumptions as an implementation hint; spec core is technology-agnostic.

- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
